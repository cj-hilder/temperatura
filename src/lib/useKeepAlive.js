/**
 * Background keep-alive for BLE data and alarms with the screen locked.
 *
 * A locked screen makes Android/Chrome suspend page timers, throttle BLE event
 * dispatch, and stop audio — which would silence alarms and let the 5 s
 * data-loss watchdog fire spuriously. The only reliable way a PWA holds
 * execution through the lock is to look like an *active media player*, which
 * requires THREE things together (all learned from a working reference PWA on
 * the same platform):
 *
 *   1. A running AudioContext producing (inaudible) output — but it MUST be
 *      resumed: a freshly-created context can start "suspended" even inside a
 *      user gesture, in which case the oscillator never actually plays and the
 *      keep-alive is dead on arrival. gain 0.001 (≈94 dB down) is inaudible but
 *      non-zero; a true 0 (or an over-quiet 0.0001) risks being treated as
 *      silence and denied audio focus. 1 Hz is safely sub-audible.
 *   2. navigator.mediaSession with metadata + playbackState 'playing' — THIS is
 *      what makes Android treat the tab as a foreground-equivalent media player
 *      (it appears in the notification shade) and exempts it from background
 *      suspension. Audio alone is not enough.
 *   3. A screen Wake Lock, re-acquired on the 'release' event and on
 *      visibilitychange. The Wake Lock API auto-releases when the page hides, so
 *      we track *intent* separately and re-acquire whenever we still want it.
 *
 * NOTE: this is best-effort. It is demonstrably enough to keep audio + timers
 * alive through a lock on Android/Chrome; whether Android also lets BLE
 * notifications and vibration through the lock is a separate platform policy,
 * handled by the notification round trip rather than this hook.
 *
 * Returns { start, stop } — call start() from a user gesture (autoplay/AudioContext
 * both require one), stop() when no longer needed.
